New data from the South Pole Telescope indicates that the birth of the
first massive galaxies that lit up the early universe was an explosive
event, happening faster and ending sooner than suspected.

Extremely bright, active galaxies formed and fully illuminated the
universe by the time it was 750 million years old, or about 13 billion
years ago, according to Oliver Zahn, a postdoctoral fellow at the
Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) at the University of
California, Berkeley, who led the data analysis.
