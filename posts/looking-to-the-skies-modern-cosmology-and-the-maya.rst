In this video, Berkeley Lab astrophysicists and Nobel laureates, George
Smoot and Saul Perlmutter -- joined by Berkeley Lab physicist Eric
Linder and UC anthropologist Gerardo Aldana -- explore the cultural and
scientific connections between Mayan astronomers and modern cosmologists
as they look to the skies for answers to how the universe evolved, how
it might end, and our place in it. The fundamental human curiosity about
our origins and fate, a quest that persists across time and cultures,
has been enriched by recent discoveries about dark energy, the Big Bang,
and the accelerating universe. New knowledge has only increased our
sense of wonder about the cosmos and deepened our appreciation for what
the Mayans achieved using only the naked eye.
