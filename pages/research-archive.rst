George Smoot and John Mather won the `2006 Nobel prize in physics
<http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/index.html>`_
"for their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the
cosmic microwave background radiation."

This historic discovery was a result of NASA's COBE (Cosmic Background
Explorer) satellite mission. Dr. Smoot was the lead scientist of the
Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) team on COBE. The DMRs were
developed to to map the cosmic microwave background radiation precisely.
The COBE mission was created to measure the diffuse infrared and cosmic
microwave background radiation from the early universe to the limits set
by our astrophysical environment.

COBE was launched on November 18, 1989 and carried three instruments:
DIRBE (the Diffuse InfraRed Experiment) to search for and measure the
cosmic infrared background radiation, DMR (Differential Microwave
Radiometers) to map the cosmic microwave background radiation, and
FIRAS (Far-InfraRed Absolute Spectrophotometer) to compare the
spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation with that from a
precise blackbody. Read more about COBE `here

MAXIPOL was a bolometric balloon-borne experiment designed to measure
the E-mode polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMB) on angular scales of 10' to 2Â°. MAXIPOL was the first
CMB experiment to collect data with a polarimeter. The primary data set
was collected during a 26 hour turnaround flight that was launched from
the National Scientific Ballooning Facility in Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in
May 2003. During this flight five regions of the sky were mapped.

MAX, MAXIMA, and BOOMERANG were part of the NSF Center for Particle
Astrophysics. The purpose of MAX, MAXIMA and BOOMERANG was to measure
and eventually map cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies on the
sub-degree angular scale level. This is a significantly smaller angular
scale than COBE (>7 degrees) observations. Read more about
MAXIPOL `here <http://groups.physics.umn.edu/cosmology/maxipol/>`_.
