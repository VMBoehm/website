NOW TAKING REGISTRATIONS (SEE BELOW)! PLEASE REGISTER BY NOV 30, 2014 TO
BE CONSIDERED FOR THE SYMPOSIUM!!!
|CtU2015new|\ |CtU2015|\ |CtU2015|\ From Jan 12-16, 2015 we will host
our new annual "Computing the Universe" symposium and workshop,
dedicated to bringing new solutions to some of the most pressing data
analysis challenges in Cosmology and Computational Astrophysics.

Mornings will feature review talks on cosmology-specific data science
topics as well as recent astrophysical data releases, and “cosmo data
hacks” in the afternoons, where we will apply new methods and streamline
existing ones to analyze these data sets in a highly hands-on fashion.

Berkeley features mild weather with significant sunshine during January.
There will be an excursion to the beach or to SF (in case of less than
optimal weather).

There will be no registration fee and we are making reservations for
housing at LBL guest house and nearby hotels.
