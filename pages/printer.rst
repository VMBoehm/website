We have a black and white printer located in NCH 341. 

To use the printer you must be connected to Eduroam, AirBears2, or wired network in 341.
If your connection is wired to another instituion via VPN, the printer won't work.

The address is

- ``136 152 250 132``

(Add '.' to the address to make it proper)

The protocal is 

- ``IPP``

For Mac, the make is ``Brother HL5450DN``.

For Windows and Linux, the driver is ``Generic PCL 6``. (PCL XL may work too)

Ubuntu Linux may need to install a package with name ``gutenprint``

If you find issues setting up the printer, talk to Yu Feng.
