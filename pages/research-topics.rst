CMB Cosmology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most conclusive evidence for The Big Bang is the isotropic
radiation that permeates the entire universe - the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). It was first predicted by Ralph Alpher, Robert Herman,
and George Gamow in 1948 while working on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were attempting to distinguish
and measure sources of noise in a radio receiver they built at Bell
Labs. They found that a persistent signal occurred regardless of the
antenna's direction. At nearby Princeton University, researchers Robert
Dicke and Dave Wilkinson were designing an experiment to find the CMB.
When they heard about Penzias and Wilson's work, they knew the CMB was
the source of the excess noise - the relic radiation of the Big Bang.
Penzias and Wilson received the 
`Nobel Prize <http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/>`_ 
for their discovery in 1978.

The above image is a `Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) <http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`_ map of the CMB. 
WMAP is a NASA
Explorer mission that launched June 2001 to make fundamental
measurements of cosmology. Although the temperature of the CMB is almost
completely uniform at 2.7 K, the map shows there are tiny variations, or
anisotropies, in the temperature on the order of 10 :sup:`-5` K. The
anisotropies appear on the map as cooler blue and warmer red
patches.These anisotropies, or "ripples" in the temperature map,
correspond to areas of various density fluctuations in the early
universe. Eventually, gravity would draw these fluctuations into even
denser areas. After billions of years and gravitational attraction,
these minute ripples in the early universe evolved into the planets,
stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies that we see today.

Dark Energy
~~~~~~~~~~~

Dark energy is the name given to the unknown physics causing the current
acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Whether dark energy is truly a new
component of energy density or an extension of gravitational physics
beyond general relativity is not yet known.

The consequences of dark energy for fundamental physics will not be
clear until its origin is discovered, but the effects on the universe
are dramatic. Dark energy effectively contributes 70-75% of the current
energy density of the universe, governing the expansion of space,
causing it to accelerate over the last ~5 billion years, and will
determine the fate of the universe. Such a phenomenon is not predicted
within the standard model of particle physics nor within experimental
experience of gravity as an attractive force.

BCCP explores dark energy from many directions, including theory,
computer simulations, and diverse experimental projects. We look at the
ties to high energy physics, quantum physics, and gravity and
investigate its signatures on supernova distances and cosmic structure
over the history of the universe.

Dark Matter
~~~~~~~~~~~

   :align: left

We believe that most of the matter in the universe is dark - it
cannot be detected from the light which it emits (or fails to emit). Its
presence is inferred indirectly from the motions of astronomical objects
- specifically stellar, galactic, and galaxy cluster/supercluster
observations. Dark matter has measurable effects on
the \ `anisotropies <http://astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/whatarecmb.html>`__ observed
in the \ `cosmic microwave
background <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation>`__ and
plays a central role in the modeling of structure formation and galaxy
evolution (shown in this \ `NASA ESA
image </images/research/darkmattermap.jpg>`__).

We have four lines of evidence for dark matter in cosmology: the
formation of large scale structure in the length of time since
decoupling requires it; the limits on the baryon density from primordial
nucleosynthesis requires it; the velocities of stars within galaxies and
of galaxies with clusters require it; leading theories of particle
physics predict it. The cosmological effects of dark matter on
cosmic structure provide one of the best windows on this physics beyond
the \ `Standard Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model>`__ of
particle physics.

Dark matter was postulated by Fritz Zwicky in 1934, to account for
evidence of "missing mass" in the orbital velocities of galaxies in
clusters. According to new supernova observations and Big Bang
cosmology, dark matter accounts for 23 percent of the total mass-energy
of the observable universe. Dark matter comprises about 6 times more
matter than ordinary baryons do.

Theoretical Cosmology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Theoretical cosmology <http://www.euclid-ec.org/>`_ involves analysis of data with an eye to current
theories, making predictions from theories and coming up with theories.
It includes a wide range of topics, from dark energy, inflation, dark
matter and neutrino masses to galaxy and cluster formation, reionization
and structure formation (e.g. characterization of emergent phenomena
such as the cosmic web or the regularities observed in galaxy
properties). For many of the physical cosmology problems, numerical
simulation in particular is extremely useful, and in fact crucial, for
incorporating correlations implicit in the cosmic web and providing a
framework for evolution within it. A flood of observational data has
become available in recent years, and is growing steadily. Currently, in
many parts of physical cosmology, theory is racing to keep up and to
make testable predictions for observations, as the latter grow in
precision and richness.

Galaxy and Distant Object Observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Galaxy & Extremely Distant Object Observations map the baryonic or
"regular matter" in the universe, giving us an incomplete description
and missing the majority of stuff in it - including dark matter and dark
energy. However, combining our models and indirect measurements of dark
matter and energy with precise surveys, systematically mapping galaxies
in the universe is the most powerful cosmological tool available.

The 
`Far-Infrared background <http://www-astro.lbl.gov/~bruce/spitzerlblpage/>`_ (Far IR)
measurements improve our understanding of the structure of the universe
and the galaxy population mix at a distance of about 7-11 billion light
years. Far IR also reveals the evolution of dusty starburst galaxies,
and the measurement of the 'bias' - the ratio of baryonic to total
matter in the universe.

The `Big BOSS <http://bigboss.lbl.gov/>`_ project aims to measure
the distribution of baryonic matter in bright galaxies and quasars over
the entire sky out to a distance of nearly 14 billion light years. Such
exquisitely precise baryonic mapping will permit a huge leap in our
understanding of dark energy. Baryonic mapping provides an improved
measurement of the equation of state of the universe in addition to
numerous other improved cosmological measurements - even an improved
measurement of neutrino masses. Big BOSS measures the appearance of an
cosmic "standard ruler", the acoustic oscillations in the early
universe. See the full explanation `here <http://bigboss.lbl.gov/>`_.

BCCP scientists are involved in a project to measure very early optical
light from gamma-ray bursts, the Ultra-Fast Flash Observatory. Gamma-ray
bursts give us a view of some of the most distant objects known, so far
up to 18 billion light years away. These objects may turn out to be a
type of "calibratable" standard candle, in which case they would give us
the best picture of our universe at extreme distances.
