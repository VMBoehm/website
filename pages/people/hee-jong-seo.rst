|image0| My research interests are in high precision cosmology with
large scale structure. I have studied analytically and numerically the
performance of the BAO in large galaxy surveys as a dark energy probe. I
also worked on the evolution of galaxy clustering and halo occupation
distribution, using dissipationless N-body simulations. My recent
research have aimed at extending my previous work as well as expanding
to observational and experimental studies and to weak lensing study: I
have worked on nonlinear effects on BAO in depth with various
high-resolution simulations, the effect of galaxy bias and redshift
distortions on BAO, a feasibility of a BAO survey in radio bands, and
combining BAO with SN data from SDSS. The ongoing projects are 1.
measuring the power spectrum of cosmic shear from SDSS Stripe 82 2.
re-capturing more cosmic information by Gaussianizing the convergence
field 3. deriving a BAO constraint from the SDSS III imaging data.
