Although I am broadly interested in astrophysics and cosmology, my
recent work has focused on using the 21cm hyperfine transition
of neutral hydrogen atoms to map our Universe.  This technique, known
as 21cm tomography, will eventually survey the distribution of matter
in a larger faction of our observable Universe than current
cosmological probes such as galaxy surveys and the cosmic microwave
background. In addition to providing better constraints on
cosmological parameters, this will allow precision tests of inflation
and competitive bounds on the neutrino mass. Crucially, 21cm
tomography will also be the only direct observational probe the Epoch
of Reionization (EoR), during which the first stars and galaxies
formed.  Understanding how these first structures formed will help to
complete the story of our Universe's transformation from a set of
primordial fluctuations to the rich collection of astronomical
structures that we see today. Unfortunately, 21cm tomography is
technically challenging and has yet to mature into a practical probe
of cosmology. My recent research has thus focused on bridging the gap
between the theoretical promise and observational reality of 21cm
tomography. This has led to algorithm development for radio telescope
calibration, studies of Galactic and xtragalactic foreground
contamination, and methods for foreground subtraction. Experimental
design and a critical examination of observationally measurable
statistics have also been recent considerations. I am also part of a
number of observational groups, including the MWA, GMRT-EoR, and
PAPER, and am involved in data analysis efforts. Early attempts at
detecting a genuine cosmological signal from the data have been
encouraging, if challenging, and suggest that 21cm tomography will
soon be able to live up to its great potential.
