The main focus of my research is physical cosmology, a worldwide effort
to explain the inner workings of our universe on its largest scales in
terms of physics that we know, understand, and love. In particular,
cosmological observations now show that in addition to the matter
present in the standard model of particle physics, the universe is
filled with two extra components: dark matter and dark energy. Dark
matter is a component that is coupled to known matter and fields
gravitationally, but does not interact significantly through any other
force. Luckily, theorists are able produce many ideas of what this
elusive dark matter particle could be, and some will be tested soon at
the Large Hadron Collider in Cern. Dark Energy is an even more
mysterious component. It is a smooth, invisible component that drives
the recent acceleration of the universe. Its energy scale is different
to understand within the context of the standard model of particle
physics. Nevertheless, we have now seen it in many different
cosmological probes. Some theoretical physicists think that the
existence of dark energy in terms of vacuum energy is most natural and
should be expected, while others think it is the strangest thing they
have ever encountered. My job as a cosmologist (in working at the
interface between theory and experiment) is to work around various
astrophysical and observational limitations to extract the maximum
amount of information from the available observational data. Following
is a short description of research that I am currently pursuing. Most of
my research is done with collaborators, too numerous to cite.

**Lyman Alpha Forest**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|HIRES Spectrum of HS 0105+1619. The messy stuff left to the Lyman-Alpha
peak at around 4450 Angstroms is the forest.| HIRES Spectrum of HS
0105+1619. The messy stuff left to the Lyman-Alpha peak at around 4450
Angstroms is the forest. Light from distant quasars is absorbed by the
neutral hydrogen atoms along the line of sight. This produces a
characteristic structure in the spectra of quasars that we call Lyman
Alpha Forest. By studying the statistical properties of these spectra we
can infer the statistics of the underlying matter distribution. This can
in turn be used to constrain various parameters of the cosmological
model, most importantly properties of neutrinos (very important
subatomic particles), the details about how the inflation took place and
early dark energy. In particular, I am focused on measuring the 3-point
statistics also known as bi-spectrum.

**Supernova data**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4526 (High-Z Supernova Search Team/HST/NASA) Supernovae act as standard
candles, which allow us to use them to measure the expansion history of
the universe. I have not only used supernovae to constrain cosmology in
some of my parameter estimation ventures, but have also done research on
the effect of their peculiar velocities. Coherent motions in the
universe produce coherent perturbations on the supernovae luminosities,
allowing one to probe perturbations in the universe while at the same
time reducing our ability to probe the background expansion of the
universe. With collaborators from Oxford, we were first to measure this
effect.              

**Large Scale Structure data**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Way. Image courtesy the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Large Scale Structure
data is an umbrella term covering measurements of clustering properties
of objects in the universe. These include data from "nearby" galaxies
from the redshift surveys, such as SDSS and 2dF, as well as measurements
of correlation properties of luminous red galaxies (LRG) and
quasi-stellar objects (QSO or quasars). I have recently been involved in
a project to determine the amount of local non-Gaussianity using the
scale dependent bias of these probes.                    

**Cosmic Microwave Background**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|array|\ The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the relic radiation
emitted about 400,000 years after the Big Bang and contains a plethora
of information about our universe, its contents, and geometry. It is the
most important and clean cosmological probe available to us. I was
involved in measurements of the CMB fluctuations as a graduate student
working with the Very Small Array (VSA). I have published more papers on
various aspects of the CMB and WMAP, including work on the famous axis
of evil (claimed correlation between hydrogen and CMB spots) and our
ability to measure difference in neutrino masses from the              
         

**Neutrinos and other thermal relics**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

for three equally massive neutrinos (dotted) and one massive and 2 light
neutrinos (dashed). Solid line shows a massless neutrino case.| A plot
showing suppression in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations for
three equally massive neutrinos (dotted) and one massive and 2 light
neutrinos (dashed). Solid line shows a massless neutrino case. The early
history of the universe is a beautiful probe of basic physics, because
it very simple: it is hot and homogeneous and therefore its state is
completely described by one parameter: temperature. By calculating how
the universe cools and how various particles condense in this process,
we are able to put very strong limits on various fundamental particles,
such as neutrinos, thermalized warm dark matter particles, axions, and
similar species.

  `**Galaxy Zoo** <http://galaxyzoo.org/>`__ is a project to harness the
power of the internet to morphologically classify nearly a million
galaxies from the SDSS catalogue. I was a member of the core team since
the inception of the project. Response from the public has been
astonishing - over 100 thousands individuals registered to participate
and we have an average of over 30 classifications per galaxy. Scientific
results are quite exciting as well and we are publishing results very
soon.
