George Smoot was co-awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics
"for discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation.” Smoot received Bachelor degrees (1966)
in Mathematics and Physics and a Ph.D. (1970) in Physics from MIT. Smoot
has been at the University of California Berkeley and the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory since 1970. In April 1992, George Smoot
made the announcement that the team he led had detected the long sought
variations in the early Universe that had been observed by the COBE DMR.
NASA's COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite mapped the intensity
of the radiation from the early Big Bang and found variations so small
they had to be the seeds on which gravity worked to grow the galaxies,
clusters of galaxies, and clusters of clusters that are observed in the
universe today. These variations are also relics of creation.

   Dr. Smoot receives the Nobel Prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf
   of Sweden, December 2006

Professor Smoot is an author of more than 200 science papers and is
also co-author (with Keay Davidson) of the popularized scientific book
Wrinkles in Time (Harper, 1994) that elucidates cosmology and the COBE
discovery. Another essay entitled “My Einstein Suspenders” appears in
My Einstein: Essays by Twenty-four of the World's Leading Thinkers on
the Man, His Work, and His Legacy (Ed. John Brockman, Pantheon,
2006). Currently, Professor Smoot conducts research in astrophysics
and observational cosmology, and is most famous for his research on
the cosmic background radiation. This radiation is thought to be the
relic of the intense heat of the early Big Bang. Smoot continues
research in cosmology and is currently involved in the Planck and SNAP
missions. The Planck mission is the third generation mission to
exploit the CMB fluctuations discovered by COBE DMR. SNAP is a mission
to understand the Dark Energy causing the current expansion of the
Universe to accelerate.
