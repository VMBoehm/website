I am a theoretical astrophysicist specializing in the large-scale
structure of the universe and models of galaxy bias. I use
measurements of galaxy clustering from surveys such as the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, and Deep
Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe to connect the distribution of
galaxies to the dark matter that lies underneath. Galaxy bias can
either be thought of as a nuisance parameter to navigate when trying
to constrain cosmological parameters from clustering measurements, or
it can be used as a tool to gain insight on the formation of evolution
of galaxies themselves.

My research attempts to meet both goals. I was a graduate student at
Ohio State University (2000-2005), where I worked with David Weinberg
on developing a theoretical framework for using upcoming galaxy
clustering measurements to constrain cosmology. After finishing at
Ohio State, I moved on to the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics
at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Andrey Kravtsov.

At Chicago I extended my research into numerical simulations of cosmic
structure and the properties of dark matter halos realized in such
simulations. I am currently developing a model for quasar absorption
lines, such as MgII or Lyman-limit systems, that encompasses such
objects into our framework of large scale structure. This will put
both condensed baryonic objects (ie, galaxies) and extended gaseous
halos (ie, the material from which galaxies form) within the same
theoretical model, providing insight into the formation mechanisms of
galactic structure.
