--------

Oliver Zahn is a computational/theoretical astrophysicist and recently
appointed Executive Director of BCCP. He originally came to Berkeley as
inaugural Center Fellow after undergraduate work at Max-Planck-Insitute
for Astrophysics and NYU, as well as doctoral work at Harvard and
Heidelberg. Zahn oversees Berkeley's cosmology program as well as its
new data science initiative. Trained as a multipurpose cosmologist, his
research program tries to advance the understanding of the origin and
evolution of structure in the Universe by applying a variety of
analytical and numerical methods to complementary astrophysical
observables. He frequently connects data to theory through massively
parallel simulations of cosmological structure formation.   Zahn also
analyses terabyte surveys of the Cosmic Microwave Background, Galaxies,
and Galaxy clusters to generate insights into the workings of the
cosmos. His team was the first to discover an effect called
gravitational lensing (bending of light rays by gravity) in the Cosmic
Microwave Background, and he has proposed novel methods for studying the
first galaxies, Big Bang, and dark energy/gravity theory, acting as
drivers for new generations of microwave, radio, and sub-mm telescopes
that are now scanning the skies.
