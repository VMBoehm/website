Week of November 24
===================

**Tuesday, November 25** 

- `Berkeley Cosmology Seminar <http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/sem_bcg_future.html>`_

  | Location: UCB, Hearst Field Annex B-1 – 1:10 pm
  | Speaker: Camille Avestruz, Yale
  | Title: "Cosmological Simulations of Galaxy Cluster Outskirts"

  Abstract: The observational study of galaxy cluster outskirts is a
  new territory to probe the thermodynamic and chemical structure of
  the X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM).  Cluster outskirts are
  particularly important for modeling the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect,
  which is sensitive to hot electrons at all radii and has been used
  to detect hundreds of galaxy clusters with recent microwave cluster
  surveys. In cluster-based cosmology, measurements of cluster
  outskirts are an important avenue for estimating the cluster mass,
  as the outskirts are less sensitive to baryonic processes that
  dominate the cluster core. However, recent observations of cluster
  outskirts deviate from theoretical expectations, indicating that
  cluster outskirts are more complicated than previously thought.
  Computational modeling of cluster outskirts is necessary to
  interpret these observations. I will present cosmological
  simulations of galaxy cluster formation that follow the
  thermodynamic and chemical structures in the virialization regions
  of the ICM and transition to the IGM.  Specifically, I will discuss
  how observational signatures of galaxy clusters are affected by gas
  flows, inhomogeneities in the ICM, and non-equilibrium physics.

  | Title: "Massive neutrinos and the Large Scale Structures of the Universe"

  Abstract: Massive neutrinos have peculiar effects on several
  observables in current and future redshift surveys. A precise
  determination of them is crucial not only to constraint properly
  neutrino masses but also to avoid potential systematic errors in the
  determination of other cosmological parameters, e.g. the dark energy
  equation of state. In this talk, after a brief review of linear theory
  results, I will discuss, with the help of a large suite of N-body
  simulations, the effect of massive neutrinos on different cosmological
  probes, like the abundance of massive clusters, the non linear matter
  power spectrum and its relation to the galaxy power spectrum, redshift
  space distorsions, and the bispectrum. http://www-theory.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/talks/plans.cgi

  | Title: "The ADMX Experiment“ 

  Abstract: The nature of dark matter is one of the great mysteries of
  modern physics. Existence of dark matter has been inferred from its
  gravitational effects over many distance scales, but currently no
  known particle can account for the observed data. As a result, new
  particles beyond the standard model have been suggested. The axion
  is one such particle that was originally devised as a solution to
  the strong-CP problem in nuclear physics (or the peculiar absence of
  a measurable electric dipole moment in the neutron). The Axion Dark
  Matter eXperiment (ADMX), and its sister experiment ADMX-High
  Frequency (ADMX-HF), are designed to detect axions by using large
  microwave cavities immersed in a strong magnetic field to resonantly
  convert the axion’s rest mass into detectable photons. In this talk
  I will describe the history of axion searches and the ADMX
  experiment in particular, which ran at LLNL for over a decade before
  being moved to the University of Washington. I will then discuss the
  upgrades to the ADMX experiment as it prepares for its upcoming
  search with orders-of-magnitude greater sensitivity. I will also
  outline R&D efforts currently being undertaken to expand the search
  range of ADMX further and ultimately determine if axions are, or are
  not, the major dark matter component of the Universe.

**Friday, November 21**

  | Speaker: Ryan Cooke (UC Santa Cruz) 
  | Title: "The primordial deuterium abundance and the search for new physics"
 
  Abstract: We are currently in an exciting era of precision
  cosmology.  With the release of the cosmic microwave background data
  recorded by the Planck satellite, we are now in a position to
  accurately test the standard model of cosmology and particle
  physics. In this talk, I will present several precise measurements
  of the primordial abundance of deuterium - the most accurate
  measurements to date - derived from redshift ~3 metal-poor damped
  Lyman-alpha systems. These data have offered a new insight into the
  physical laws of the Universe just minutes after the Big Bang. Such
  precise measures, when analyzed in conjunction with the Planck data,
  now place strong bounds on both the total amount of visible matter
  in the Universe and the effective number of neutrino species. These
  data further provide new limits on physics beyond the standard
  model. I will discuss our ongoing survey to obtain new precision
  measures of the primordial nuclei in the era of the 30m class
  telescopes.
