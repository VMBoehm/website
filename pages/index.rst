Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole since its
inception. BCCP is focused on understanding the origin and evolution of
the universe through a series of programs to define the observations,
experiments, concepts, and simulations needed to answer the fundamental
questions in cosmology. Combining experimentation, computation, and
theory, BCCP continues to develop the foundation of an accurate,
reliable model of the cosmos. We compare the implications of this
evolving model against observations â€” thus opening new horizons and
expanding our knowledge of the universe. BCCP research programs are
addressing the following major questions:

-  What is dark energy and how is it causing the expansion of the
   universe to accelerate?
-  How did space-time originate early in the universe?
-  What is dark matter?
-  Why is there an excess of matter over antimatter in the current
   universe when they were in equal abundance at very early stages of
   universe evolution?
