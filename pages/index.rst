   <p>The Berkeley Center For Cosmological Physics (BCCP) is focused
   on understanding the origin and evolution of the universe through a
   series of programs to define the observations, experiments,
   concepts, and simulations needed to answer the fundamental
   questions in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">cosmology</a>.</p>
   <p>Combining experimentation, computation, and theory, BCCP
   continues to develop the foundation of an accurate, reliable model
   of the cosmos. We compare the implications of
   this evolving model against observations â€” thus opening new
   horizons and expanding our knowledge of the universe.</p>
