   Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole since its
   inception. 
   
   Here at Berkeley Center For Cosmological Physics (BCCP) 
   we focus on understanding the origin and evolution of
   the universe through a series of programs to define the observations,
   experiments, concepts, and simulations needed to answer the fundamental
   questions in cosmology. 
   
   Combining experimentation, computation, and
   theory, BCCP continues to develop the foundation of an accurate,
   reliable model of the cosmos. We compare the implications of this
   evolving model against observations â€” thus opening new horizons and
   expanding our knowledge of the universe. BCCP research programs are
   addressing the following major questions:

   -  What is dark matter?
   -  What is dark energy?
   -  How is it causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate?
   -  And I have edited this page.
