Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics Partner Fund
------------------------------------------------------

Unlocking the mysteries of the universe is an exciting scientific
challenge. How will we succeed? With visionary funders who understand
the magnitude of the moment and are willing to make an investment in the
future of science. As a heroic partner with the BCCP, we can illuminate
the infrastructure of the universe and help nurture the next generation
of promising scientists. 

The very human desire to
know, to understand, to be part of a grand intellectual journey is
motivating a remarkable quest. The concentration of talent at the BCCP
is dedicated to teaching as well as research. This creates a singular
opportunity to involve today's educators in an equally heroic pursuit -
engaging and inspiring the next generation of physicists, engineers,
mathematicians, teachers, and citizen-scientists. 

An investment in the
BCCP is not only an investment in the future of cosmology. It also means
creating a model of inquiry that can usher in a new era of 21st century
science - with the utility and power to solve very complex problems.
Having pioneered data analysis procedures for extremely large data sets,
cosmological methodologies have great potential for many other data
intensive fields - climate change being the most urgent. Cosmology
research created an enormous impact on many disciplines - seeding
advances in math, chemistry, engineering, physics, astronomy,
astrophysics, particle physics, biology, and even theology and
philosophy. 

As the University embarks on the 
`Campaign for Berkeley <http://givetocal.berkeley.edu/browse/?u=235>`_  ( http://campaign.berkeley.edu/ ),
BCCP's frontier research and education depends on private philanthropy from UCB
alumni and friends, corporations, and foundations. Gifts to Berkeley
play an essential role both in sustaining fundamental traditions of
excellence and in moving the University forward decisively.
