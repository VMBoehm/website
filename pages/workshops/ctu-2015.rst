|CtU2015|

From Jan 12-16, 2015 we will host our new annual "Computing the
Universe" symposium and workshop, dedicated to bringing new solutions
to some of the most pressing data analysis challenges in Cosmology and
Computational Astrophysics.

Mornings will feature review talks on cosmology-specific data science
topics as well as recent astrophysical data releases, and “cosmo data
hacks” in the afternoons, where we will apply new methods and
streamline existing ones to analyze these data sets in a highly
hands-on fashion.

Berkeley features mild weather with significant sunshine during
January.  There will be an excursion to the beach or to SF (in case of
less than optimal weather).

There will be no registration fee and we are making reservations for
housing at LBL guest house and nearby hotels.
