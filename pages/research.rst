Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole since its
inception. BCCP is focused on understanding the origin and evolution of
the universe through a series of programs to define the observations,
experiments, concepts, and simulations needed to answer the fundamental
questions in cosmology. Combining experimentation, computation, and
theory, BCCP continues to develop the foundation of an accurate,
reliable model of the cosmos. We compare the implications of this
evolving model against observations — thus opening new horizons and
expanding our knowledge of the universe. BCCP research programs are
addressing the following major questions:

-  What is dark energy and how is it causing the expansion of the
   universe to accelerate?
-  How did space-time originate early in the universe?
-  What is dark matter?
-  Why is there an excess of matter over antimatter in the current
   universe when they were in equal abundance at very early stages of
   universe evolution?

**CMB Cosmology**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image0|

The most conclusive evidence for \ *The Big Bang* is the isotropic
radiation that permeates the entire universe - the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). It was first predicted by Ralph Alpher, Robert Herman,
and George Gamow in 1948 while working on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were attempting to distinguish
and measure sources of noise in a radio receiver they built at Bell
Labs. They found that a persistent signal occurred regardless of the
antenna's direction. At nearby Princeton University, researchers Robert
Dicke and Dave Wilkinson were designing an experiment to find the CMB.
When they heard about Penzias and Wilson's work, they knew the CMB was
the source of the excess noise - the relic radiation of the Big Bang.
Penzias and Wilson received the \ `Nobel
Prize <http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/>`__ for
their discovery in 1978.

The above image is a \ `Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) <http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`__ map of the CMB. WMAP is a NASA
Explorer mission that launched June 2001 to make fundamental
measurements of cosmology. Although the temperature of the CMB is almost
completely uniform at 2.7 K, the map shows there are tiny variations, or
anisotropies, in the temperature on the order of 10\ :sup:`-5`\ K. The
anisotropies appear on the map as cooler blue and warmer red
patches.These anisotropies, or "ripples" in the temperature map,
correspond to areas of various density fluctuations in the early
universe. Eventually, gravity would draw these fluctuations into even
denser areas. After billions of years and gravitational attraction,
these minute ripples in the early universe evolved into the planets,
stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies that we see today.

Studying the CMB reveals conditions of the early universe. Experiments

**Dark Energy**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

Dark energy is the name given to the unknown physics causing the current
acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Whether dark energy is truly a new
component of energy density or an extension of gravitational physics
beyond general relativity is not yet known.

The consequences of dark energy for fundamental physics will not be
clear until its origin is discovered, but the effects on the universe
are dramatic. Dark energy effectively contributes 70-75% of the current
energy density of the universe, governing the expansion of space,
causing it to accelerate over the last ~5 billion years, and will
determine the fate of the universe. Such a phenomenon is not predicted
within the standard model of particle physics nor within experimental
experience of gravity as an attractive force.

BCCP explores dark energy from many directions, including theory,
computer simulations, and diverse experimental projects. We look at the
ties to high energy physics, quantum physics, and gravity and
investigate its signatures on supernova distances and cosmic structure
over the history of the universe.

**Dark Matter**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image2| We believe that most of the matter in the universe is dark - it
cannot be detected from the light which it emits (or fails to emit). Its
presence is inferred indirectly from the motions of astronomical objects
- specifically stellar, galactic, and galaxy cluster/supercluster
observations. Dark matter has measurable effects on
the \ `anisotropies <http://astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/whatarecmb.html>`__ observed
in the \ `cosmic microwave
background <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation>`__ and
plays a central role in the modeling of structure formation and galaxy
evolution (shown in this \ `NASA ESA
image <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/o/Images/darkmattermap.jpg>`__).

We have four lines of evidence for dark matter in cosmology: the
formation of large scale structure in the length of time since
decoupling requires it; the limits on the baryon density from primordial
nucleosynthesis requires it; the velocities of stars within galaxies and
of galaxies with clusters require it; leading theories of particle
physics predict it. The cosmological effects of dark matter on
cosmic structure provide one of the best windows on this physics beyond
the \ `Standard Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model>`__ of
particle physics.

Dark matter was postulated by Fritz Zwicky in 1934, to account for
evidence of "missing mass" in the orbital velocities of galaxies in
clusters. According to new supernova observations and Big Bang
cosmology, dark matter accounts for 23 percent of the total mass-energy
of the observable universe. Dark matter comprises about 6 times more
matter than ordinary baryons do.

**`Theoretical Cosmology <http://astro.berkeley.edu/~jcohn/tcosmo.html>`__**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Theoretical cosmology involves analysis of data with an eye to current
theories, making predictions from theories and coming up with theories.
It includes a wide range of topics, from dark energy, inflation, dark
matter and neutrino masses to galaxy and cluster formation, reionization
and structure formation (e.g. characterization of emergent phenomena
such as the cosmic web or the regularities observed in galaxy
properties). For many of the physical cosmology problems, numerical
simulation in particular is extremely useful, and in fact crucial, for
incorporating correlations implicit in the cosmic web and providing a
framework for evolution within it. A flood of observational data has
become available in recent years, and is growing steadily. Currently, in
many parts of physical cosmology, theory is racing to keep up and to
make testable predictions for observations, as the latter grow in
precision and richness.

**Galaxy and Distant Object Observations**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image3|

*Galaxy & Extremely Distant Object Observations* map the baryonic or
"regular matter" in the universe, giving us an incomplete description
and missing the majority of stuff in it - including dark matter and dark
energy. However, combining our models and indirect measurements of dark
matter and energy with precise surveys, systematically mapping galaxies
in the universe is the most powerful cosmological tool available.

The \ `Far-Infrared
background <http://www-astro.lbl.gov/~bruce/spitzerlblpage/>`__ (Far IR)
measurements improve our understanding of the structure of the universe
and the galaxy population mix at a distance of about 7-11 billion light
years. Far IR also reveals the evolution of dusty starburst galaxies,
and the measurement of the 'bias' - the ratio of baryonic to total
matter in the universe.

The \ *`Big BOSS <http://bigboss.lbl.gov/>`__* project aims to measure
the distribution of baryonic matter in bright galaxies and quasars over
the entire sky out to a distance of nearly 14 billion light years. Such
exquisitely precise baryonic mapping will permit a huge leap in our
understanding of dark energy. Baryonic mapping provides an improved
measurement of the equation of state of the universe in addition to
numerous other improved cosmological measurements - even an improved
measurement of neutrino masses. Big BOSS measures the appearance of an
cosmic "standard ruler", the acoustic oscillations in the early
universe. See the full explanation \ `here <http://bigboss.lbl.gov/>`__.

BCCP scientists are involved in a project to measure very early optical
light from gamma-ray bursts, the Ultra-Fast Flash Observatory. Gamma-ray
bursts give us a view of some of the most distant objects known, so far
up to 18 billion light years away. These objects may turn out to be a
type of "calibratable" standard candle, in which case they would give us
the best picture of our universe at extreme distances.

**BCCP Major Projects**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BCCP cosmologists are world leaders in the newest approach to dark
energy measurements - Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).  By studying
the clustering of nearby galaxies, we can detect the imprint of the
sound waves that were “frozen in” as the cosmic plasma of the early
universe cooled — the same acoustic phenomena that produced the
anisotropies we see in the \ `Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/o/cmb.html>`__. By comparing the
structure in the CMB with the distribution of galaxies in the near
universe, we obtain a measurement of the properties of dark energy
causing the recent cosmic acceleration. This gives a new window on the
phenomenon, which is independent of the one using supernovae, providing
a complementary way of understanding the history of the universe and
what drives it. The Center’s scientists are developing a new project
that can make a dramatic step forward in BAO dark energy measurements.
The survey is designed to obtain spectra of 1.5 million galaxies at
z<0.7, and 160,000 quasars for the BAO signal at much higher redshifts.

**`PolarBeaR <http://bolo.berkeley.edu/polarbear/>`__ (Polarization of
Background Radiation)**

BCCP scientists are at the forefront of CMB instrumentation
developments. We have instruments running on several cutting-edge
experiments, including the \ `Planck
satellite <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/o/planck.html>`__ and the \ `South
Pole Telescope <http://pole.uchicago.edu/>`__, which is currently
collecting the best data of small angular scale anisotropies. The Planck
satellite was launched on May 14, 2009.  BCCP Director George Smoot has
been involved in the Planck mission since its inception, and is a senior
member of the project. PolarBeaR is undergoing construction and will
eventually observe from the high Atacama Desert in Chile, with even
better sensitivity although over a smaller area of sky. The ambitious
goal of this work is to search for the signature of gravity waves from
the inflationary era of the universe 10\ :sup:`-35` seconds after the
Big Bang at energies of 10\ :sup:`16` GeV. Such a discovery would reveal
the universe at energy scales that probe fundamental physics beyond the
reach of particle accelerators - a critical step in efforts to map the
entire history of the universe. These projects illustrate the diverse
capabilities of BCCP, including:

-  *CMB experience in the \ `Berkeley Department of
   Physics <http://physics.berkeley.edu/>`__*
-  *Experience with large detector systems*
-  *Parallel supercomputing expertise
   at \ `NERSC <http://www.nersc.gov/>`__*
-  *Electromagnetic design expertise
   at \ `RAL <http://ral.berkeley.edu/>`__*
-  *The micro fabrication facilities in Berkeley’s electrical
   engineering program*

**The Legacy Supernova Calibration Program**

All of the major programs proposed for the next decade that use
supernovae to study dark energy will require a novel supernova
calibration program. These include the dramatic example of the JDEM
satellite project supernova probe and the Nearby Supernova Factory, a
key element of JDEM that demonstrated the basic steps required. Our next
task will be to design and develop a project that will scale up this
work to reach the numbers and precision needed. The Center’s scientists
in this field (leaders of the \ `Supernova Cosmology
Project <http://supernova.lbl.gov/>`__, \ `JDEM <http://jdem.lbl.gov/>`__,and
the \ `Nearby Supernova Factory <http://snfactory.lbl.gov/>`__) are
beginning work on this next step. Like mapping the trajectory of a ball
(that forms a parabola when gravity is uniform and an ellipse when it is
not) documenting the brightness of supernova in the universe to map the
history of cosmic expansion will inform our understanding of time,
space, and the behavior of gravity.

 

|image7|\ `Computional Cosmology
Center <https://c3.lbl.gov/index.html>`__

Although cosmology has now matured to the point that we can make
significant progress in understanding key physics questions by
constructing high-precision experiments, designing and executing such
experiments requires a new level of theoretical, analytic, and
computational sophistication that is almost unprecedented in
astrophysical measurements. The exciting projects thus appear to have a
somewhat different characteristic than previous astronomy projects: the
data are complex enough that those theorists who understand the details
of the data are often needed to participate in the analysis.
Sophisticated computing capabilities are needed by both the
experimentalists and the theorists. Typically, the analysis of these
observational data now takes longer than the experiment itself!

The experimental and the theoretical — the data analysis and the
simulations — are in fact tightly interwoven in today’s cosmology. Many
of the key questions in cosmology rely on subtle signals in the data and
require theoretically sophisticated approaches to data analysis and
interpretation. Simulations are required both as event generators for
modeling the analysis pipelines and as the theoretical predictions
themselves. Numerical simulations are indispensable in investigating how
the universe evolved from the minute primordial fluctuations into the
highly nonlinear web of galaxies and clusters observed today.

|image8|\ **6) EoR (Epoch of Reionization)**

The goal of the EoR experiment is to directly detect emission from
hydrogen during the epoch of reionization — the period just after the
“dark ages” when stars were beginning to form and the modern universe is
just beginning. As the majority of baryonic matter is in the form of
hydrogen, reionization usually refers to the reionization of hydrogen
gas. There may be more than one epoch of reionization as
recent \ `WMAP <http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`__ and high redshift quasars
are beginning to reveal. Our next steps are to develop a prototype
two-element radio interferometer and testing.

`Dark Energy Survey <https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/>`__

The dark energy survey is an imaging survey, beginning 2012, with a new
instrument (DECam) on the 4 meter Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory in Chile. It will be imaging 5000 square degrees in the
south in grizy, over 5 years, collecting information on ~300 million
galaxies up to redshift ~1. Measurements of supernovae, baryon acoustic
oscillations, galaxy clusters and weak gravitational lensing will be
used to constrain the properties of dark energy. As a wide and deep
survey, the data set will be rich enough to apply other probes of dark
energy as they are developed, or other probes of cosmology more
generally.

**Former Projects**

**`COBE - COsmic Background
Explorer <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/o/cobehome.html>`__**

George Smoot and John Mather won the \ `2006 Nobel prize in
physics <http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/index.html>`__ "for
their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation."

|image10|

This historic discovery was a result of NASA's COBE (Cosmic Background
Explorer) satellite mission. Dr. Smoot was the lead scientist of the
Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) team on COBE. The DMRs were
developed to to map the cosmic microwave background radiation precisely.
The COBE mission was created to measure the diffuse infrared and cosmic
microwave background radiation from the early universe to the limits set
by our astrophysical environment.

COBE was launched on November 18, 1989 and carried three instruments:
DIRBE (the Diffuse InfraRed Experiment) to search for and measure the
cosmic infrared background radiation, DMR (Differential Microwave
Radiometers) to map the cosmic microwave background radiation, and FIRAS
(Far-InfraRed Absolute Spectrophotometer) to compare the spectrum of the
cosmic microwave background radiation with that from a precise
blackbody. Read more about the
mission \ `here <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/o/cobehome.html>`__.

`**MAXIPOL** <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/o/maxipol.html>`__

|image11|

MAXIPOL was a bolometric balloon-borne experiment designed to measure
the E-mode polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMB) on angular scales of 10' to 2°. MAXIPOL was the first
CMB experiment to collect data with a polarimeter. The primary data set
was collected during a 26 hour turnaround flight that was launched from
the National Scientific Ballooning Facility in Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in
May 2003. During this flight five regions of the sky were mapped.

MAX, MAXIMA, and BOOMERANG were part of the NSF Center for Particle
Astrophysics. The purpose of MAX, MAXIMA and BOOMERANG was to measure
and eventually map cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies on the
sub-degree angular scale level. This is a significantly smaller angular
scale than COBE (>7 degrees) observations. Read more about
MAXIPOL \ `here. <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/o/maxipol.html>`__
